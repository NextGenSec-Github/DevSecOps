# Step 1: Understanding Kubernetes Security Concepts

In this step, we will delve into the fundamental security concepts of Kubernetes to lay the groundwork for securing your Kubernetes cluster effectively.

## 1. Authentication

Authentication is the process of establishing the identity of users, processes, or devices accessing the Kubernetes cluster.

### Practical Example:

To authenticate users, Kubernetes supports various mechanisms such as:

- **Client Certificates**: Users can authenticate using client certificates signed by a trusted CA.
- **Bearer Tokens**: Users can provide bearer tokens for authentication.

Ensure authentication mechanisms are properly configured and enforced in your Kubernetes cluster.

## 2. Authorization

Authorization determines what actions are allowed based on the authenticated identity.

### Practical Example:

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is commonly used in Kubernetes for authorization. Define roles and bind them to users or groups to grant specific permissions.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "list"]
