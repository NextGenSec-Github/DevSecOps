# Step 6: Harden Container Filesystem

Hardening the container filesystem is essential for improving the security posture of your containerized applications. By implementing measures such as using read-only filesystems and minimizing writable directories, you can mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and tampering with container contents. In this guide, we'll explore how to harden the container filesystem effectively.

## Why Harden Container Filesystem?

- **Mitigated File System Attacks**: Hardening the container filesystem helps mitigate the risk of file system-based attacks, such as unauthorized modification of critical files or injection of malicious code.
- **Reduced Attack Surface**: By minimizing writable directories and limiting file system access, you reduce the attack surface and potential entry points for attackers.
- **Enhanced Security Isolation**: Implementing read-only filesystems and other hardening measures enhances the security isolation of containers, reducing the impact of security breaches.

## Harden Container Filesystem

### Use Read-Only Filesystem

Mount critical directories as read-only within the container to prevent unauthorized modifications. This ensures that sensitive files remain immutable and reduces the risk of tampering.

```Dockerfile
# Mount sensitive directories as read-only
VOLUME /var/log:ro
```

### Minimize Writable Directories
Minimize the number of writable directories within the container by limiting write access to only essential directories required for the application's operation.
```Dockerfile
# Create a writable directory for application data
RUN mkdir /app/data && chown appuser:appuser /app/data
VOLUME /app/data
```

### Disable Unnecessary Filesystem Features
Disable unnecessary filesystem features within the container to reduce the attack surface and mitigate the risk of exploitation. For example, you can disable the use of setuid and setgid permissions.
```Dockerfile
# Disable setuid and setgid permissions
RUN find / -perm /6000 -type f -exec chmod a-s {} \;
```

## Best Practices
- **Follow the Principle of Least Privilege:** Restrict filesystem access to only essential directories and files required for the application's functionality.
- **Regularly Review and Update:** Periodically review and update container filesystem hardening measures to ensure alignment with security best practices and application requirements.
- **Test in Staging Environment:** Test hardened filesystem configurations in a staging environment to verify compatibility and functionality before deploying to production.

## Conclusion
Harden the container filesystem is a critical aspect of container image hardening. By implementing measures such as using read-only filesystems, minimizing writable directories, and disabling unnecessary filesystem features, you can enhance the security of your containerized applications and reduce the risk of unauthorized access and tampering.
