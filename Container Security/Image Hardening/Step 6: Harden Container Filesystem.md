# Step 6: Harden Container Filesystem

Hardening the container filesystem is essential for improving the security posture of your containerized applications. By implementing measures such as using read-only filesystems and minimizing writable directories, you can mitigate the risk of unauthorized access and tampering with container contents. In this guide, we'll explore how to harden the container filesystem effectively.

## Why Harden Container Filesystem?

- **Mitigated File System Attacks**: Hardening the container filesystem helps mitigate the risk of file system-based attacks, such as unauthorized modification of critical files or injection of malicious code.
- **Reduced Attack Surface**: By minimizing writable directories and limiting file system access, you reduce the attack surface and potential entry points for attackers.
- **Enhanced Security Isolation**: Implementing read-only filesystems and other hardening measures enhances the security isolation of containers, reducing the impact of security breaches.

## Harden Container Filesystem

### Use Read-Only Filesystem

Mount critical directories as read-only within the container to prevent unauthorized modifications. This ensures that sensitive files remain immutable and reduces the risk of tampering.

```Dockerfile
# Mount sensitive directories as read-only
VOLUME /var/log:ro
