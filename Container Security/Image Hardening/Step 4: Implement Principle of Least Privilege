# Step 4: Implement Principle of Least Privilege

Implementing the principle of least privilege is essential for enhancing the security of your containerized applications. By running containers with the least privileges necessary, you can reduce the potential impact of security breaches and limit attackers' ability to escalate privileges. In this guide, we'll explore how to implement the principle of least privilege in Docker containers.

## Why Implement Principle of Least Privilege?

- **Minimized Attack Surface**: Limiting container privileges reduces the attack surface by restricting access to system resources and sensitive operations.
- **Mitigated Security Risks**: Running containers with minimal privileges helps mitigate security risks, such as privilege escalation attacks and container breakout attempts.
- **Compliance Requirements**: Implementing least privilege is often a requirement for compliance with security standards and regulations.

## Implementing Principle of Least Privilege

### Use Non-Root User

Avoid running containers as the root user whenever possible. Instead, create and use a non-root user within the container to restrict privileges.

```Dockerfile
# Create a non-root user
RUN adduser --disabled-password myuser

# Switch to non-root user
USER myuser
