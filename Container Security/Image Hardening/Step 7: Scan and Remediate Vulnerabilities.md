# Step 7: Scan and Remediate Vulnerabilities

Regularly scanning container images for vulnerabilities and promptly remediating any identified issues is crucial for maintaining the security of your containerized applications. In this guide, we'll explore how to scan container images for vulnerabilities using tools like Clair, Trivy, or Anchore Engine, and how to remediate vulnerabilities effectively.

## Why Scan and Remediate Vulnerabilities?

- **Mitigated Security Risks**: Scanning container images for vulnerabilities helps identify security risks and weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers.
- **Compliance Requirements**: Many security standards and regulations require regular vulnerability scanning and remediation to ensure compliance.
- **Enhanced Security Posture**: Promptly remediating vulnerabilities improves the overall security posture of your containerized applications and reduces the risk of security breaches.

## Scan Container Images for Vulnerabilities

### Use Vulnerability Scanning Tools

Integrate vulnerability scanning tools like Clair, Trivy, or Anchore Engine into your container image build pipeline to automatically scan images for known vulnerabilities.

```bash
# Example using Trivy
trivy image <image_name>
```

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) Pipeline Integration
Incorporate vulnerability scanning into your CI/CD pipeline to automate the scanning process and ensure that only images free of critical vulnerabilities are deployed to production.
```yaml
# Example configuration for GitLab CI/CD
image:
  name: docker:stable

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - scan
  - deploy

trivy_scan:
  stage: scan
  script:
    - trivy image <image_name>
```
