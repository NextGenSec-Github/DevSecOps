# Step 1: Choose a Minimal Base Image

Choosing a minimal base image is the first step in container image hardening. Minimal base images reduce the attack surface and improve the security posture of your containers. In this guide, we'll explore how to choose and use a minimal base image for Docker containers.

## Why Choose a Minimal Base Image?

- **Reduced Attack Surface**: Minimal base images contain only essential components, reducing the potential entry points for attackers.
- **Improved Performance**: Smaller images result in faster container startup times and reduced resource consumption.
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Minimal base images require fewer updates and patches, simplifying maintenance efforts.

## Examples of Minimal Base Images

### Alpine Linux

Alpine Linux is a popular choice for minimal base images due to its small size and security-focused design.

```Dockerfile
# Use Alpine Linux as the base image
FROM alpine:latest

# Example commands to install packages (replace with your application dependencies)
RUN apk --no-cache add \
    python3 \
    && pip3 install --no-cache-dir \
    package1 \
    package2

# Example command to start your application
CMD ["python3", "app.py"]
