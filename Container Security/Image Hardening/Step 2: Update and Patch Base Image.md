# Step 2: Update and Patch Base Image

Regularly updating and patching the base image is essential to maintaining the security of your containerized applications. In this guide, we'll explore how to update and patch the base image in Docker containers.

## Why Update and Patch Base Image?

- **Security Fixes**: Updates and patches often include fixes for known security vulnerabilities, reducing the risk of exploitation.
- **Stability Improvements**: Updates may include stability improvements and bug fixes, enhancing the reliability of your containers.
- **Compliance Requirements**: Regular updates help ensure compliance with security standards and regulations.

## Updating and Patching Base Image

### Dockerfile Approach

One way to update and patch the base image is by rebuilding your Docker image with the latest version of the base image. This approach ensures that your image contains the most up-to-date packages and security patches.

```Dockerfile
# Use the latest version of the base image
FROM alpine:latest

# Update package repositories and install security updates
RUN apk update && apk upgrade
```

### Automated Build Pipelines
Integrate automated build pipelines into your development workflow to automatically rebuild and deploy Docker images whenever updates are available. Tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or GitHub Actions can automate the process of updating and patching base images.
