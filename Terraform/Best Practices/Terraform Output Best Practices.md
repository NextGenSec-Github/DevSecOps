# Terraform Output Best Practices

## 1. Document Outputs:

Provide comprehensive documentation for each output to guide users on its purpose and usage. Include examples and any relevant considerations.

*Example:*

```hcl
output "public_ip" {
  description = "The public IP address of the deployed instance"
  value       = aws_instance.example.public_ip
}
```

## Use Descriptive Names:

Choose names that clearly convey the purpose of the output. This improves readability and understanding, reducing the need for extensive documentation.

*Example:* 

```hcl
output "database_address" {
  value = aws_db_instance.example.address
}
```

## 3. Avoid Sensitive Information:

Never expose sensitive information through outputs. Keep confidential details secure and consider using other methods like secure parameter storage.

## 4. Version Outputs:

Consider versioning outputs to maintain compatibility across different releases of your infrastructure.

## 5. Avoid Excessive Outputs:

Only expose necessary outputs to keep your configuration clear. Avoid information overload for users consuming the outputs.

## 6. Use Output Variables:

Leverage output variables to enhance modularity. This creates a clean interface between different Terraform modules.

*Example:* 

```hcl
output "vpc_id" {
  value = module.networking.vpc_id
}
```
