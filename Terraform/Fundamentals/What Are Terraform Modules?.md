## 1. Introduction

As your infrastructure grows, maintaining and organizing Terraform code becomes crucial for scalability and maintainability. Terraform Modules provide a way to encapsulate and reuse infrastructure code, making it easier to manage complex configurations and promote code reusability.

## 2. What are Terraform Modules?

Terraform Modules are self-contained packages of Terraform configurations that can be used to encapsulate and organize infrastructure code. A module can represent a single piece of infrastructure, such as a virtual machine, a network, or a complete application stack.

Modules enable you to:

- **Reuse Code:** Modules can be reused across different projects, promoting consistency and reducing duplication of code.
- **Abstract Complexity:** Complex infrastructure configurations can be abstracted into a module, providing a clean interface for users.
- **Encapsulate Logic:** Modules encapsulate logic and variables, allowing for more straightforward and consistent deployments.

## 3. Key Concepts

### Module Structure

A Terraform Module typically has the following structure:

module/
|-- main.tf
|-- variables.tf
|-- outputs.tf
|-- ... (other files and folders)
