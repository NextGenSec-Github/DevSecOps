## Introduction

Terraform Outputs allow you to expose specific values from your infrastructure configuration, making them accessible for use in other configurations or for external consumption. This feature is valuable for obtaining information about resources created during the Terraform apply process.

## What are Terraform Outputs?

Terraform Outputs are a way to share information from your Terraform configuration with other parts of your infrastructure or external systems. They provide a mechanism for capturing and making available specific values generated during the execution of Terraform configurations.

## Declaring Outputs

### Output Syntax

Declare outputs using the `output` block within your Terraform configuration:

```hcl
output "instance_ip" {
  value = aws_instance.example.public_ip
}
```
