# GKE Pipeline Using Cloud Build

In this hands-on project, you create a CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds a container image from committed code, stores the image in Artifact Registry, updates a Kubernetes manifest in a Git repository, and deploys the application to Google Kubernetes Engine using that manifest.

You will create 2 Git repositories:

1. app repository: contains the source code of the application itself

2. env repository: contains the manifests for the Kubernetes Deployment

When you push a change to the app repository, the Cloud Build pipeline runs tests, builds a container image, and pushes it to Artifact Registry. After pushing the image, Cloud Build updates the Deployment manifest and pushes it to the env repository. This triggers another Cloud Build pipeline that applies the manifest to the GKE cluster and, if successful, stores the manifest in another branch of the env repository.

The app and env repositories are kept separate because they have different lifecycles and uses. The main users of the app repository are actual humans and this repository is dedicated to a specific application. The main users of the env repository are automated systems (such as Cloud Build), and this repository might be shared by several applications. The env repository can have several branches that each map to a specific environment (you only use production in this lab) and reference a specific container image, whereas the app repository does not.

## Getting Started

**Activate Cloud Shell**

Click Activate Cloud Shell Activate Cloud Shell icon at the top of the Google Cloud console.

## Initialize 

1. In Cloud Shell, set your project ID and project number. Save them as PROJECT_ID and PROJECT_NUMBER variables:

```bash
export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
export PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe $PROJECT_ID --format='value(projectNumber)')
export REGION=
gcloud config set compute/region $REGION
```
2. Run the following command to enable the APIs for GKE, Cloud Build, Cloud Source Repositories and Container Analysis:
```bash
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com \
    cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
    sourcerepo.googleapis.com \
    containeranalysis.googleapis.com
```

3. Create an Artifact Registry Docker repository named `my-repository` in the region to store your container images:
```bash
gcloud artifacts repositories create my-repository \
  --repository-format=docker \
  --location=$REGION
```

4. Create a GKE cluster to deploy the sample application of this lab:

```bash
  gcloud container clusters create hello-cloudbuild --num-nodes 1 --region $REGION
```

5. If you have never used Git in Cloud Shell, configure it with your name and email address. Git will use those to identify you as the author of the commits you will create in Cloud Shell:

```bash
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

## Create the Git repositories in Cloud Source Repositories

Now we will create the two Git repositories (hello-cloudbuild-app and hello-cloudbuild-env) and initialize hello-cloudbuild-app with some sample code.

1. In Cloud Shell, run the following to create the two Git repositories:
```bash
#app repository
gcloud source repos create hello-cloudbuild-app
```
```bash
#env repository
gcloud source repos create hello-cloudbuild-env
```

2. Clone the sample code from GitHub: 

```bash
cd ~
```
```bash
# NOTE: This code is from Google's repository
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gke-gitops-tutorial-cloudbuild hello-cloudbuild-app
```

3. Configure Cloud Source Repositories as a remote:
```bash
cd ~/hello-cloudbuild-app
```

```bash
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
```

```bash
git remote add google "https://source.developers.google.com/p/${PROJECT_ID}/r/hello-cloudbuild-app"
```

The code you just cloned contains a simple flask "Hello World" application.

## Create a container image with Cloud Build

The code you cloned already contains the following Dockerfile.

![](https://github.com/yusufmunircloud/AWS-Projects/blob/main/img/general/Screenshot%202024-01-19%20224559.png?raw=true)

With this Dockerfile, you can create a container image with Cloud Build and store it in Artifact Registry.

1. In Cloud Shell, create a Cloud Build build based on the latest commit with the following command:

```bash
cd ~/hello-cloudbuild-app
```

```bash
COMMIT_ID="$(git rev-parse --short=7 HEAD)"
```

```bash
gcloud builds submit --tag="${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/my-repository/hello-cloudbuild:${COMMIT_ID}" .
```
Cloud Build streams the logs generated by the creation of the container image to your terminal when you execute this command.

2. After the build finishes, in the Cloud console go to Artifact Registry > Repositories to verify that your new container image is indeed available in Artifact Registry. Click my-repository.

## Create the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline

Now we will configure Cloud Build to automatically run a small unit test, build the container image, and then push it to Artifact Registry. Pushing a new commit to Cloud Source Repositories triggers this pipeline automatically. The cloudbuild.yaml file already included in the code is the pipeline's configuration.

1. In the Cloud console, go to Cloud Build > Triggers.

2. Click Create Trigger

3. In the Name field, type hello-cloudbuild.

4. Under Event, select Push to a branch.

5. Under Source, select hello-cloudbuild-app as your Repository and .* (any branch) as your Branch.

6. Under Build configuration, select Cloud Build configuration file.

7. In the Cloud Build configuration file location field, type cloudbuild.yaml after the /.

8. Click Create.

When the trigger is created, return to the Cloud Shell. You now need to push the application code to Cloud Source Repositories to trigger the CI pipeline in Cloud Build.

9. To start this trigger, run the following command:
```bash
cd ~/hello-cloudbuild-app
```
```bash
git push google master
```

10. In the Cloud console, go to Cloud Build > Dashboard.

11. You should see a build running or having recently finished. You can click on the build to follow its execution and examine its logs.

## Create the Test Environment and CD pipeline

Cloud Build is also used for the continuous delivery pipeline. The pipeline runs each time a commit is pushed to the candidate branch of the hello-cloudbuild-env repository. The pipeline applies the new version of the manifest to the Kubernetes cluster and, if successful, copies the manifest over to the production branch. This process has the following properties:

- The candidate branch is a history of the deployment attempts.
- The production branch is a history of the successful deployments.
- You have a view of successful and failed deployments in Cloud Build.
- You can rollback to any previous deployment by re-executing the corresponding build in Cloud Build. A rollback also updates the production branch to truthfully reflect the history of deployments.

## Grant Cloud Build access to GKE

To deploy the application in your Kubernetes cluster, Cloud Build needs the Kubernetes Engine Developer Identity and Access Management role.

1. In Cloud Shell execute the following command:

```bash
PROJECT_NUMBER="$(gcloud projects describe ${PROJECT_ID} --format='get(projectNumber)')"
```
```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${PROJECT_NUMBER} \
--member=serviceAccount:${PROJECT_NUMBER}@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com \
--role=roles/container.developer
```
You need to initialize the hello-cloudbuild-env repository with two branches (production and candidate) and a Cloud Build configuration file describing the deployment process.

The first step is to clone the hello-cloudbuild-env repository and create the production branch. It is still empty.

2. In Cloud Shell execute the following command:
```bash
cd ~
```
```bash
gcloud source repos clone hello-cloudbuild-env
```
```bash
cd ~/hello-cloudbuild-env
```
```bash
git checkout -b production
```

3. Next you need to copy the cloudbuild-delivery.yaml file available in the hello-cloudbuild-app repository and commit the change:

```bash
cd ~/hello-cloudbuild-env
```
```bash
cp ~/hello-cloudbuild-app/cloudbuild-delivery.yaml ~/hello-cloudbuild-env/cloudbuild.yaml
```
```bash
git add .
```
```bash
git commit -m "Create cloudbuild.yaml for deployment"
```

The cloudbuild-delivery.yaml file describes the deployment process to be run in Cloud Build. It has two steps:

- Cloud Build applies the manifest on the GKE cluster.
- If successful, Cloud Build copies the manifest on the production branch.

4. Create a candidate branch and push both branches for them to be available in Cloud Source Repositories:

```bash
git checkout -b candidate
```
```bash
git push origin production
```
```bash
git push origin candidate
```

5. Grant the Source Repository Writer IAM role to the Cloud Build service account for the hello-cloudbuild-env repository:
```bash
PROJECT_NUMBER="$(gcloud projects describe ${PROJECT_ID} \
--format='get(projectNumber)')"
cat >/tmp/hello-cloudbuild-env-policy.yaml <<EOF
bindings:
- members:
  - serviceAccount:${PROJECT_NUMBER}@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com
  role: roles/source.writer
EOF
```
```bash
gcloud source repos set-iam-policy \
hello-cloudbuild-env /tmp/hello-cloudbuild-env-policy.yaml
```

## Create the trigger for the continuous delivery pipeline

1. In the Cloud console, go to Cloud Build > Triggers.
   
2. Click Create Trigger.

3. In the Name field, type hello-cloudbuild-deploy.

4. Under Event, select Push to a branch.

5. Under Source, select hello-cloudbuild-env as your Repository and ^candidate$ as your Branch.

6. Under Build configuration, select Cloud Build configuration file.

7. In the Cloud Build configuration file location field, type cloudbuild.yaml after the /.

8. Click Create.

## Modify the continuous integration pipeline to trigger the continuous delivery pipeline.

Next, add some steps to the continuous integration pipeline that will generate a new version of the Kubernetes manifest and push it to the hello-cloudbuild-env repository to trigger the continuous delivery pipeline.

1. Copy the extended version of the cloudbuild.yaml file for the app repository:

```bash
cd ~/hello-cloudbuild-app
```
```bash
cp cloudbuild-trigger-cd.yaml cloudbuild.yaml
```

The cloudbuild-trigger-cd.yaml is an extended version of the cloudbuild.yaml file. It adds the steps below: they generate the new Kubernetes manifest and trigger the continuous delivery pipeline.

2. Commit the modifications and push them to Cloud Source Repositories:


```bash
cd ~/hello-cloudbuild-app
```
```bash
git add cloudbuild.yaml
```
```bash
git commit -m "Trigger CD pipeline"
```
```bash
git push google master
```

## Review Cloud Build Pipeline

1. In the Cloud console, go to Cloud Build > Dashboard.

2. Click into the hello-cloudbuild-app trigger to follow its execution and examine its logs. The last step of this pipeline pushes the new manifest to the hello-cloudbuild-env repository, which triggers the continuous delivery pipeline.

3. Return to the main Dashboard.

4. You should see a build running or having recently finished for the hello-cloudbuild-env repository. You can click on the build to follow its execution and examine its logs.

## Test the complete pipeline

The complete CI/CD pipeline is now configured. Test it from end to end.

1. In the Cloud console, go to Kubernetes Engine > Services & Ingress.

There should be a single service called hello-cloudbuild in the list. It has been created by the continuous delivery build that just ran.

2. Click on the endpoint for the hello-cloudbuild service. You should see "Hello World!". If there is no endpoint, or if you see a load balancer error, you may have to wait a few minutes for the load balancer to be completely initialized. Click Refresh to update the page if needed.

3. In Cloud Shell, replace "Hello World" with "Hello Cloud Build", both in the application and in the unit test:

```bash
cd ~/hello-cloudbuild-app
```
```bash
sed -i 's/Hello World/Hello Cloud Build/g' app.py
```
```bash
sed -i 's/Hello World/Hello Cloud Build/g' test_app.py
```
