# GKE Pipeline Using Cloud Build

In this hands-on project, you create a CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds a container image from committed code, stores the image in Artifact Registry, updates a Kubernetes manifest in a Git repository, and deploys the application to Google Kubernetes Engine using that manifest.

You will create 2 Git repositories:

1. app repository: contains the source code of the application itself

2. env repository: contains the manifests for the Kubernetes Deployment

When you push a change to the app repository, the Cloud Build pipeline runs tests, builds a container image, and pushes it to Artifact Registry. After pushing the image, Cloud Build updates the Deployment manifest and pushes it to the env repository. This triggers another Cloud Build pipeline that applies the manifest to the GKE cluster and, if successful, stores the manifest in another branch of the env repository.

The app and env repositories are kept separate because they have different lifecycles and uses. The main users of the app repository are actual humans and this repository is dedicated to a specific application. The main users of the env repository are automated systems (such as Cloud Build), and this repository might be shared by several applications. The env repository can have several branches that each map to a specific environment (you only use production in this lab) and reference a specific container image, whereas the app repository does not.

## Getting Started

**Activate Cloud Shell**

Click Activate Cloud Shell Activate Cloud Shell icon at the top of the Google Cloud console.

## Initialize 

1. In Cloud Shell, set your project ID and project number. Save them as PROJECT_ID and PROJECT_NUMBER variables:

```bash
export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
export PROJECT_NUMBER=$(gcloud projects describe $PROJECT_ID --format='value(projectNumber)')
export REGION=
gcloud config set compute/region $REGION
```
2. Run the following command to enable the APIs for GKE, Cloud Build, Cloud Source Repositories and Container Analysis:
```bash
gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com \
    cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
    sourcerepo.googleapis.com \
    containeranalysis.googleapis.com
```

3. Create an Artifact Registry Docker repository named `my-repository` in the region to store your container images:
```bash
gcloud artifacts repositories create my-repository \
  --repository-format=docker \
  --location=$REGION
```

4. Create a GKE cluster to deploy the sample application of this lab:

```bash
  gcloud container clusters create hello-cloudbuild --num-nodes 1 --region $REGION
```

5. If you have never used Git in Cloud Shell, configure it with your name and email address. Git will use those to identify you as the author of the commits you will create in Cloud Shell:

```bash
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
```

## Create the Git repositories in Cloud Source Repositories

Now we will create the two Git repositories (hello-cloudbuild-app and hello-cloudbuild-env) and initialize hello-cloudbuild-app with some sample code.

1. In Cloud Shell, run the following to create the two Git repositories:
```bash
#app repository
gcloud source repos create hello-cloudbuild-app
```
```bash
#env repository
gcloud source repos create hello-cloudbuild-env
```

2. Clone the sample code from GitHub: 

```bash
cd ~
```
```bash
# NOTE: This code is from Google's repository
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gke-gitops-tutorial-cloudbuild hello-cloudbuild-app
```

3. Configure Cloud Source Repositories as a remote:
```bash
cd ~/hello-cloudbuild-app
```

```bash
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
```

```bash
git remote add google "https://source.developers.google.com/p/${PROJECT_ID}/r/hello-cloudbuild-app"
```

The code you just cloned contains a simple flask "Hello World" application.

## Create a container image with Cloud Build

The code you cloned already contains the following Dockerfile.

![](https://github.com/yusufmunircloud/AWS-Projects/blob/main/img/general/Screenshot%202024-01-19%20224559.png?raw=true)

With this Dockerfile, you can create a container image with Cloud Build and store it in Artifact Registry.

1. In Cloud Shell, create a Cloud Build build based on the latest commit with the following command:

```bash
cd ~/hello-cloudbuild-app
```

```bash
COMMIT_ID="$(git rev-parse --short=7 HEAD)"
```

```bash
gcloud builds submit --tag="${REGION}-docker.pkg.dev/${PROJECT_ID}/my-repository/hello-cloudbuild:${COMMIT_ID}" .
```
Cloud Build streams the logs generated by the creation of the container image to your terminal when you execute this command.

2. After the build finishes, in the Cloud console go to Artifact Registry > Repositories to verify that your new container image is indeed available in Artifact Registry. Click my-repository.

## Create the Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline

Now we will configure Cloud Build to automatically run a small unit test, build the container image, and then push it to Artifact Registry. Pushing a new commit to Cloud Source Repositories triggers this pipeline automatically. The cloudbuild.yaml file already included in the code is the pipeline's configuration.

1. In the Cloud console, go to Cloud Build > Triggers.

2. Click Create Trigger

3. In the Name field, type hello-cloudbuild.

4. Under Event, select Push to a branch.

5. Under Source, select hello-cloudbuild-app as your Repository and .* (any branch) as your Branch.

6. Under Build configuration, select Cloud Build configuration file.

7. In the Cloud Build configuration file location field, type cloudbuild.yaml after the /.

8. Click Create.

When the trigger is created, return to the Cloud Shell. You now need to push the application code to Cloud Source Repositories to trigger the CI pipeline in Cloud Build.

9. To start this trigger, run the following command:
```bash
cd ~/hello-cloudbuild-app
```
```bash
git push google master
```

10. In the Cloud console, go to Cloud Build > Dashboard.

11. You should see a build running or having recently finished. You can click on the build to follow its execution and examine its logs.

## Create the Test Environment and CD pipeline

Cloud Build is also used for the continuous delivery pipeline. The pipeline runs each time a commit is pushed to the candidate branch of the hello-cloudbuild-env repository. The pipeline applies the new version of the manifest to the Kubernetes cluster and, if successful, copies the manifest over to the production branch. This process has the following properties:

- The candidate branch is a history of the deployment attempts.
- The production branch is a history of the successful deployments.
- You have a view of successful and failed deployments in Cloud Build.
- You can rollback to any previous deployment by re-executing the corresponding build in Cloud Build. A rollback also updates the production branch to truthfully reflect the history of deployments.
